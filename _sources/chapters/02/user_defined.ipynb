    "# Defining your own functions\n",
    "The built-in functions (e.g, type, print, input) that Python provides do basic tasks. We can write our own functions that can execute complicated sequence of instructions. \n",

    "- What is a function definition?\n",
    "  - A function definition is a kind of Python statement. The general form of a function definition is as follows:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "    def <<function_name>>(<<parameters>>):\n",
    "        <<block>>\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- What is a function header? First line of function definition.\n",
    "- What is a function body? What comes after the function definition and is indented by four spaces. \n",
    "- What is a return statement? ``return <<expression>>``\n",

    "- What do you name the function?\n",
    "- What are the parameters, and what types of information do they refer to?\n",
    "- What calculations are you doing with that information?\n",

    "### Practice\n",
    "1. Write a Python function that prints the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "_____________________________\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "Happy birthday, dear John\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!\n",
    "______________________________\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Write a Python function that prints the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "______________________________\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "Happy birthday, dear Jane\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!\n",
    "______________________________\n",
    "```\n",
    "3.  Write a Python function that prints the following: \n",
    "```\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "```\n",
    "4.  Write a Python function that prints the following using the function from the previous exercise. \n",
    "```\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "Happy birthday, dear John\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "```\n",
    "5.  Repeat 4a for Jane\n",
    "```\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "Happy birthday, dear Jane\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "Happy birthday to you!!!\n",
    "```\n",
    "6.  Write a function called print_happy_birthday_name that takes the name as an parameter to the function. \n",
    "```\n",
    "Happy birthday, dear <Name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "7.  Combine the functions print_happy_birthday and print_happy_birthday_name('John')\n",
    "8.  Write a function that calculates the distance between two points and returns the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variations in functions\n",
    "- No input; no output; example -- print something\n",
    "- One or more input; no output; example -- print the input\n",
    "- One or more input: one or more output; example -- take two numbers and return their sum\n",
    "- No input; one or more output; example -- a random number\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- A function definition introduces a new variable that refers to a function object. The return statement describes the value that will be produced as a result of the function when this function is done being executed.\n",
    "- A parameter is a variable that appears between the parentheses of a function header.\n",
    "- A local variable is a variable that is used in a function definition to store an intermediate result in order to make code easier to write and read.\n",
    "- A function call tells Python to execute a function.\n",
    "- An argument is an expression that appears between the parentheses of a function call. The value that is produced when Python evaluates the expression is assigned to the corresponding parameter.\n",
    "- If you made assumptions about the values of parameters or you know that your function wonâ€™t work with particular values, write a precondition to warn other programmers."
