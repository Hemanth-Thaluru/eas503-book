    "Variables like `first`, `second`, and `third` that are created within a function are called local variables. Local variables get created each time that function is called, and they are erased when the function returns. Because they only exist when the function is being executed, they can’t be used outside of the function. This means that trying to access a local variable from outside the function is an error, just like trying to access a variable that has never been defined is an error.\n",
