# String methods
- We have already encountered functions: built-in functions and functions we have defined. A method is another kind of function that is attached to a particular type. This section covers
the methods that are attached to string types.  
- Method calls in this form—`'browning'.capitalize()`—are shorthand for this: `str.capitalize('browning')`. 
- Methods are like functions, except that the first argument must be an object of the class in which the method is defined.
