## Programming Assignments
- Descriptions for the programming assignments and necessary files will be posted on UB Learn.
- You will submit your Python file on Gradescope. 
- You have unlimited submissions/retries until the deadline 
- We will return the finalized programming assignment grades seven days after the deadline. We will announce via Piazza when the programming assignment grading has been completed. After this announcement, you have seven days to contest your grades. 
- All programming assignments must be submitted on Gradescope. If you submit on UB Learns, your assignment will not be graded. 
- The very first thing you should do when an assignment has been released, is to upload the template solution online. 


## Kritik Assignment
- No late submissions will be accepted 
- Kritik assignments have three stages: create, evaluation, feedback stage. You must complete each stage. Do not take points off when doing peer evaluation without explaining why you took points off. 
- You must use Markdown to generate an HTML file with your solution. If you do not submit an HTML file, your assignment will not be graded. 

## Mini-Projects
- Mini-projects are like programming assignments, but they are longer.
- Description of mini-projects will be posted on UB Learns along with the required files. 
- You will submit your final solution via Gradescope for mini-projects 1 and 2 and via Kritik for mini-project 3. 
- After the grades have been finalized, you have seven days to contest your grade. 

## Late Policy
You have 10 late days that you can use to submit your programming assignments and mini-projects (1-2) late. Mini-project 3 must be on time. If you submit two hours late, it will be rounded up to one day late. In order to submit a late solution, you must email the professor, TAs, and grader with your solution zipped. Python files are blocked by outlook.

## Course Resources

- This website will host the course book (https://mkzia.github.io/eas503-book)
- Github (https://github.com/mkzia/eas503) for hosting lecture Jupyter notebooks
- UB Learns will be used for distributing programming assignments' description, forming groups for projects, submitting the final project report, and managing course grades
- Kritik will be used peer evaluation assignments
- GradeScope will be used to submit programming assignments
- The first two mini-projects will be submitted on Gradescope and the final mini-project will be submitted on Kritik. 
- Piazza will be used for:
  - course announcements and updates 
  - asking the instructor and TA questions 
  - communicating with fellow classmates
  - posting links to lecture and solution recordings (see pinned post)
  - posting latest instructor and TA office hours (see pinned posts)
  - showing the latest quizzes and assignment deadlines (see pinned post)


## Preparation for the first class

- Ensure you can access EAS503 course page on UB Learns
- Ensure you can access the course book (https://mkzia.github.io/eas503-book)
- Ensure you can log into Gradescope
- Ensure you can log into Kritik and pay the fee ($24)
- Ensure you can log into Piazza
- Install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

## Academic Integrity
:::{warning}
Academic integrity is a fundamental university value. Through the
honest completion of academic work, students sustain the integrity of the university while facilitating the university’s imperative for the transmission of knowledge and culture based upon the
generation of new and innovative ideas. The UB graduate academic integrity policy is available
at https://www.buffalo.edu/grad/succeed/current-students/policy-library.html#academic-integrity.

The sharing or posting of material related to EAS 503, and requests for help or answers on
any electronic tool, such as Chegg, Stack Overflow, and Course Hero, is considered a violation of the academic integrity policy. Consequences of violating the academic integrity policy may range from zero points to expulsion from the university, depending on the seriousness of the violation.

The following are the academic integrity policies for this course:
1. If multiple students submit the same homework solution, then the involved parties will
earn zero points for the common solution(s).
2. If we can positively identify a student who has uploaded material to any online resource,
that student will earn an automatic failure in the course.
3. All students who are positively identified as viewing the solution for any length of time
will receive a score of zero for the problem(s) viewed.

All Academic Integrity violations will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity. Multiple violations of the Academic Integrity policy will result in an escalation of the imposed
sanction.

Follow good cyber-security practices. Do not provide physical or electronic access
to your computer or accounts! If another student gains or is provided access to
your computer or on-line account and they violate the Academic Integrity Policy,
you will be held responsible!

**Example 1**: Student A has been positively identified as posting a assignment question to Chegg, Stack Overflow, Course Hero.
That student will earn an “F” in the course and be reported to the University.

**Example 2**: Students B and C are working on code for a assignment together. Student B finished the code but Student C is stuck and does not know how to proceed. Student B let’s Student C look (either in person or electronically) at their code, which Student C then uses to complete the problem. Both Student B and Student C will earn a zero on the entire assignment and be reported to the University.

**Example 3**: Students D and E are working on code for a assignment together. Student D finished the code but Student E is stuck and does not know how to proceed. Students D and E verbally discuss the code but do not view each other’s code and Student D does not tell the code that Student E needs. During this Student E learns what was done wrong and how to fix it. This is not a violation of academic integrity and thus no sanction will apply.

**Example 4**: Student F’s computer is non-functional and student G allows student F access to their laptop to finish a homework. While doing so student F copies code that student G has
already completed. Both students will earn a zero on the entire homework or exam and will be
reported to the University.

**By submitting work for a grade, students are accepting the academic integrity
policy.**
